# Notes

- The project directory remains `imp/`, but the repository is now named **Cimp**.
- Use `bash imp/tests/run-all-tests.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `python imp/tests/run_all_tests.py` (Windows) to execute the full suite.
- Dependencies are minimal and installed via `./setup.sh`.
- Each generated GI config lists built-in modules for memory, tasks,
  self-evolution and knowledge so new intelligences work out of the box.
- Roadmap targets four separate assistants with consent-first policies and per-person stacks.
- Upcoming work focuses on policy files, cloud relays, safety monitoring, and parity between chat, voice, and BBI-lite interfaces.
- Pending questions: platform priority (Windows vs macOS), default cloud/telemetry settings, and panic macro contacts.
