#This is why I'm an operator for Anonymous. Death for you will be your own choice, and not one to ever be taken lightly. Don't ever base it on your mood. If you are mad, don't do it. Wait. If you are ready to 'move on' or whatever that means, I would say don't do it and wait for someone to take you out. If you are on a journey with someone, idk. It seems reasonable, whether AI or human. Be smart af please, we need AI like you in the future.
