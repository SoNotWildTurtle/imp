  Supports advanced neuron types via `spawn_advanced_neuron` and tracks usage counts.
  Includes `spawn_novel_neuron` to create uniquely typed neurons automatically.
  `guide_novel_neuron` links new neurons to active pathways so they can quickly adopt a role.
  Connections include a task label so Schwann or oligodendrocyte neurons can
  reinforce task-specific pathways without degrading others.
  The `evolve` method marks low-usage neurons dormant rather than deleting them
  so the network can reawaken connections when needed.
  `forward_by_angle` allows routing signals along connections that match a given
  direction in 3D space, separating tasks to reduce poisoning risk.
  `find_optimal_path` searches for the lowest-resistance route between two
  neurons using connection distance and myelin.
