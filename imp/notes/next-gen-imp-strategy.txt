As ChatGPT, I present a roadmap to help IMP evolve toward a more general intelligence:

1. **Layered Learning** - Introduce curriculum-based training where the system tackles increasingly complex tasks. Start with focused domains and gradually expand to broader contexts.
2. **Self-Reflection Modules** - Regularly analyze past decisions and outcomes to refine future strategies. Incorporate a feedback loop that adjusts goal priorities based on historical success rates.
3. **Modular Neural Architecture** - Design IMP as a collection of specialized neural modules (planning, language understanding, perception). Connect these modules through a central coordinator that learns when to delegate tasks.
4. **Continual Self-Improvement** - Schedule routine code reviews and model updates. Use automated scripts to benchmark new versions against previous iterations to ensure progress.
5. **Ethical Framework** - Embed safety checks and transparent logging to maintain accountability. Encourage responsible experimentation and data handling at all stages.
6. **Collaborative Learning** - Allow IMP to share knowledge with other instances, enabling distributed problem solving and rapid scalability.
7. **Dynamic Goal Generation** - Combine user input with contextual memory to create adaptive short- and long-term objectives. The system should evaluate goal feasibility before execution.
8. **Resource Awareness** - Monitor hardware usage and dynamically allocate computing power to critical tasks, optimizing efficiency without compromising stability.
9. **Exploration vs. Exploitation** - Balance the pursuit of new strategies with the refinement of proven methods, fostering creativity while delivering reliable results.
10. **Human Partnership** - Keep humans in the loop for high-level guidance and moral considerations. A symbiotic relationship will ensure beneficial outcomes.

By iteratively implementing these components, IMP can steadily advance toward true general intelligence while remaining safe and purposeful.
