Self-Evolution Test - 2025-06-08
================================

A short test was performed to evaluate IMP's self-evolution tools.

1. **imp-code-updater.py**
   - *Online mode* failed to download the GPT-2 model due to proxy restrictions.
   - *Offline mode* could not load the GGUF model because `ctransformers` was missing.

2. **Metacognitive Analysis**
   - Running `imp-metacognitive-analysis.py` created `imp-metacognitive.json` summarizing current performance metrics and past decisions.
   - No CPU spike was detected in the sample data, so the neural network was unchanged during this step.

3. **Neural Self-Evolution**
   - Using `self_evolve_neural_network` with a small training set expanded the hidden layer from 2 to 3 neurons, demonstrating stochastic architecture growth.

These results show the metacognitive module can modify the neural network, while the code updater requires additional dependencies or online access to function. Future efforts should package the required models locally and add error handling so IMP can continue evolving even without external connectivity.
