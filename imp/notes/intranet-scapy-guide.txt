IMP Intranet and Packet Sanitization Guide
==========================================

This note describes how IMP can create a lightweight intranet for secure communication among AI agents. The intranet is defined in `config/imp-intranet.json` and lists the node IPs allowed to participate.

Packet modification using Scapy allows the system to sanitize traffic on the fly. For example:

```python
from scapy.all import sniff, send
from imp.expansion.imp_intranet import sanitize_packet

# Capture packets, sanitize them, and resend
sniff(filter='tcp', prn=lambda p: send(sanitize_packet(p)))
```

This approach can be extended to route messages through a secured API that only permits whitelisted commands for communication between trusted agents.
