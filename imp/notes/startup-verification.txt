Startup Verification Log
=========================

This log records the status of each step in IMP's launch sequence using `imp/bin/imp-start.sh`.

1. Resolve project directories
   - Script computes `ROOT` and defines absolute path for the executor.
   - Status: OK

2. Launch core executor (`/root/imp/core/imp-execute.py`)
   - Verified: file exists and command issued via `nohup`.
   - Status: OK

3. Launch learning memory (`core/imp-learning-memory.py`)
   - After fix, module runs without `KeyError` when decision entries lack fields.
   - Status: OK

4. Launch strategy generator (`core/imp-strategy-generator.py`)
   - Command executed; no errors reported.
   - Status: OK

5. Launch code updater (`self-improvement/imp-code-updater.py`)
   - Started; no immediate errors in `nohup.out`.
   - Status: OK

6. Launch security optimizer (`security/imp-security-optimizer.py`)
   - Performs system audits; warnings appear if systemd or AppArmor unavailable.
   - Status: OK (with warnings)

7. Launch cluster manager (`expansion/imp-cluster-manager.py`)
   - Attempts to distribute workload; gracefully reports `Failed to copy to localhost: ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused` when SSH is unavailable.
   - Status: Warning – no remote nodes configured or SSH not accessible.

8. Verify start script executor path
   - Confirmed line 5 launches `/root/imp/core/imp-execute.py` after recent update.
   - Status: OK

Overall result: IMP startup completes; non‑critical warnings noted above.
