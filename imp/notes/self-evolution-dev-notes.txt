Self-Evolution Dev Notes (2025-06-08)
-------------------------------------

- Keep all code changes additive and store diffs in `logs/imp-update-patches`.
- When experimenting with new neurons, log outcomes in `logs/imp-model-analysis.json`.
- Use `imp-self-healer.py` after updates to verify file integrity.
- Document any failures in `logs/imp-bug-report.json` so regressions can be traced.
- Refer back to `self-evolution-plan.txt` before modifying the update scripts.

- The startup script `bin/imp-start.sh` launches `/root/imp/core/imp-execute.py` and spawns supporting modules from `core`, `self-improvement`, `security`, and `expansion`.
- Use `bin/imp-start.py` or `imp-start.ps1` on Windows to perform the same startup sequence.
- Keep `notes/project-structure.txt` current so all routes remain documented for other developers and agents.

- Line 5 of bin/imp-start.sh now launches /root/imp/core/imp-execute.py using an absolute path.
