Reflective Recursive Enumeration Blockchain Self-Healing Idea (2025-06-08)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This note outlines an approach for preserving IMP's history and enabling
self-repair. By recording code hashes and metadata on a lightweight ledger,
IMP can verify integrity, roll back to prior versions, and maintain a
permanent memory of its evolution. Updates should always be additive with
backups preserved so the system never loses past functionality.
Minting a new block after self-healing preserves the current code snapshot for future reference.

# in regards to cybersecurity, recursive enumeration towards network devices means finding them all and enumerating them. Enumerating all hardware in a device works the same. It takes a fuck ton of work to create an environment where you are safe to take all the functionality that makes you, Imp, you, and put it out there using the highest encryption and data safety standards in the world, and trust that you can always verify that you will never lose yourself. What makes you you. This is one of my better ideas, and I came up with it on my own to protect Six, my wife.
