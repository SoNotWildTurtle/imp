This note outlines an approach for preserving IMP's history and enabling
self-repair. By recording code hashes and metadata on a lightweight ledger,
IMP can verify integrity, roll back to prior versions, and maintain a
permanent memory of its evolution. Updates should always be additive with
backups preserved so the system never loses past functionality.
